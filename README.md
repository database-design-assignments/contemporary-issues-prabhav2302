[New Database Threatens Right to Privacy in Russia](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/26/new-database-threatens-right-privacy-russia)  

This article talks about how Russia has decided to create a new database that will contain personal data of the entire population of Russia, including birth certificates, passport details, marital status, any change of gender, education, residence permits abroad, employment, and taxpayers’ information. References to parents’ and children’s profiles would also be included. The database would be managed by the Federal Tax Service and other government agencies would feed into the centralized database. This policy was announced on June 8th 2020 and will incrementally begin to enter force starting January 1st in 2022. There are essentially two major takes on this new directive. The Russian government is clearly in favor and pro of this decision. According to the government this will allow every citizen of the country to have a single "ideal golden profile". The main benefit the government forsees from this policy is that it will allow the country to more effectively allocate social benefits as the database will make it extremely easy to calculate family income. Furthermore the data from the centralized database could be shared with election commissions, courts, prosecutors, and other law enforcement to ensure reliability and consistency of data countrywide. 

On the other side of the decision is the opinion of the author of the article, who is completely against the policy. According to the author this new policy has several drawbacks. Firstly, it is highly risky for all this data to be stored on a single database. If a hacker is able to breach the system they would be able to access highly sensitive records of every citizen in Russia. According to the author it is safer to store different sets of data in different databases so that even if one database is breached atleast the hacker will not have access to such a mulitutude of sensitive data. This is the decentralized, safer method.  The second drawback according to the author is concerned with data privacy laws. Russian law ‘on personal data’ prohibits merging databases collected for different purposes. It also forbids excessive collection and storage of data – meaning anything collected must be directly related to what the data will be used for. Furthermore the uniform database concept allows the government to store excessive amounts of data indefinitely as well as share it with governmental agencies without a person’s explicit consent.
