[New Database Threatens Right to Privacy in Russia](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/26/new-database-threatens-right-privacy-russia)  

This article talks about how Russia has decided to create a new database that will contain personal data of the entire population of Russia, including birth certificates, passport details, marital status, any change of gender, education, residence permits abroad, employment, and taxpayers’ information. References to parents’ and children’s profiles would also be included. The database would be managed by the Federal Tax Service and other government agencies would feed into the centralized database. This policy was announced on June 8th 2020 and will incrementally begin to enter force starting January 1st in 2022. There are essentially two major takes on this new directive. The Russian government is clearly in favor and pro of this decision. According to the government this will allow every citizen of the country to have a single "ideal golden profile". The main benefit the government forsees from this policy is that it will allow the country to more effectively allocate social benefits as the database will make it extremely easy to calculate family income. Furthermore the data from the centralized database could be shared with election commissions, courts, prosecutors, and other law enforcement to ensure reliability and consistency of data countrywide. 

On the other side of the decision is the opinion of the author of the article, who is completely against the policy. rr
